# DungeonCrawlerGame_Code

Class project. This took a 3 person team about 3 months. Project requirements were to create a dungeon crawler game, with the final product reflecting the standard software engineering design patterns that were discussed in class. Specifications did not require a GUI like the one created as a text-based game would have been acceptable. Not all code was written by me as it was a group project. Code is missing several resources so is not a working example, meant simply to be a code sample.

Potential Next Steps:

    1. Refactor the game states to simplify some of the larger classes and fix known bugs such as an incompatable event listeners and java graphical libraries that caused re-positioning issues.
    2. Expand user feedback and improve inventory usage. 
    3. Expand gameplay to multiple levels and add sound.
    4. Add animation to attack stage for more interesting play. Possible add a runaway option.
    5. Create a help menu and a way to save game progress.
    

NOTE: Code base is not written exclusively by me.
